# X-Rays

## Project Overview

The **X-Rays** project demonstrates a dynamic image display feature using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to select from a dropdown list, which then updates the displayed image accordingly. Additionally, the project includes an interactive feature where a circular clipping mask follows the mouse cursor over the selected image.

## Features

- **Dynamic Image Display**: Users can choose an option from a dropdown list to update the displayed image.
- **Interactive Clipping Mask**: The selected image is revealed through a circular clipping mask that tracks the mouse cursor's position.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to various screen sizes while maintaining its visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, including responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handling the dynamic selection and interactive features.

## How It Works

1. **Dropdown Selection**: The dropdown menu contains several options. When an option is selected, the corresponding image is displayed.
2. **Image Clipping**: The selected image is displayed with a circular clipping mask. The mask follows the cursor, revealing the image beneath it.
3. **CSS**: The clipping mask and image transition effects are achieved using CSS properties like `clip-path`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the `images` folder contains the images referenced in the code (e.g., `HTML.png`, `JAVASCRIPT.png`).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to see the project in action.

## Conclusion

The **X-Rays** project is a simple yet effective demonstration of how to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing web experience.
